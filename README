These are UGCT scripts that are used in the UGCT (Unified Game Completion Tracker) project that aims to make game tracking more easily done with power of Google Sheets.

As for now this repository is used only to backup scripts that I am working on. Only when I make an official deployment and release of the project, this repository will be (probably) used as an active development repo.

There are two branches available:
  - master - holds regular UGCT scripts.
  - ugct-micro - holds UGCT Micro scripts that are based on the master branch and are used by UGCT Micro project (to be released publicly soon).

See file modification dates for when this backup (but not necceserrily the project itself) was last updated.
